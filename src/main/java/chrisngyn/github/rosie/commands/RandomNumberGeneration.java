          make a random obj
          use it to decide one or the other
          gg
          
          t!choose arg1 | arg2 | arg3 | arg4 | arg5 - tatsu can choose MULTIPLE ARGS
          
          so after you split on (" | ") count how long it is then make the random obj. choose accordingly
